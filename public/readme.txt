Hi!

This is a simple nodejs RESTful APIs app with express framework.

First things need to do is:
1- Install npm globaly on your Os (windows - mac - ...)
2- Install nodemon for run-watching mode (install command is : "npm i -g nodemon")
   I suggest to you install as globaly packages because it is a tool not a dependency for project

So now! you must install dependency packages: (please run below command in project folder)
npm i


Welldone! app is ready to run now. run below command
nodemon index.js

tadaaa!

open browser: localhost:5000  (must see hello :))
open browser: localhost:5000/api/courses (must see course array list)

You can use Postman to Get,Post,Put,Delete Courses operators

Enjoyed.
